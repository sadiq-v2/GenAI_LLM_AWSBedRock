{"person_id":26506014,"name":"Max Werkmeister","address":"NaN, Burbank, California, NaN, US","headline":"NaN","description":"Hello, Chums. I've always wanted to open a message to strangers with that, ever since I attended the Second Grade and was tasked with coming up with a greeting for a sign in the hallway. People were pitching ideas left and right, from \"Hi, Friends\"​ to \"Hello, Pals\"​. Upon offering the synonym, \"Chums\"​, the class understandably giggled at the funny-sounding name. However, as the laughter died, my teacher turned to me and smugly chortled out, \"Well Max, most people reading this will NOT be your chums,\"​ and moved on, neglecting to write down my suggestion. This confused me and continued to do so for the following seventeen years. Was she really suggesting that strangers in the hallway happening upon our random sign would not be my chums, but would be my \"friends\"​ or my \"pals\"​? A puzzling move by a sculptor of young minds, but I didn't much care for her anyway. She once backed into my parents'​ car in the school parking lot and attempted to dodge insurance claims.

Her 19 year strong PR journey has seen her not only execute some of the most exciting and successful campaigns, but also demonstrate her advocacy strength on the importance of transforming the industry’s ‘way of work’.  For her, understating the land’s social narrative shapes how and where one should place their brand messages – whether it be hard or soft news.  It can never be a one size fits all approach – a strategy that continues to list her among some of the great PR and social media minds in South Africa.\\n\\nIn 2002, Marang co-founded Dreamcatcher Multimedia, an agency that offered integrated communication solutions such as public relations, brand activations, events and conferencing. More recently, her passion to specialise in pure brand communication has seen Marang venture out on her own business journey that she hopes will assist in positively tipping clients’ brand scales.\\n\\nOutside of business, Marang prides herself as an active social media activist and commentator on topics such as entrepreneurship, women’s rights and the powerhouse that is Africa. She’s sat on communications and advertising judging panels – learning and discovery opportunities that she says continue to help shape how she services her own clients. These include the Loeries, South Africa’s foremost media, marketing and advertising awards, for a three-year period on the PR and Live Events panel.\\nHer most current work in her incarnation as a communications consultant includes injecting her PR magic on campaigns such the launch of D’USSE XO cognac, the Bombay Sapphire #StirCreativity campaign with Maxhosa, Momentum’s #NoApologyForMySuccess Women’s Month\\nCampaign, the first XiTsonga language drama, Giyani-Land of Blood which airs on SABC, Urban Moyo restaurant,& the Handmade Contemporary Fair","created_at":"2023-12-11 06:18:08.13904","updated_at":"2023-10-26 15:57:22.35","employments":[{"company_id":"NaN","company_name":"NaN","seniority_level":"NaN","title":"Publicist","started_on":"1999-01-01","ended_on":"2001-01-01"},{"company_id":"NaN","company_name":"NaN","seniority_level":"NaN","title":"Independent PR Consultant","started_on":"2019-06-01","ended_on":"2019-12-01"},{"company_id":2289.0,"company_name":"Netflix","seniority_level":"Director","title":"Originals Publicity Director - Sub-Saharan Africa","started_on":"2020-03-01","ended_on":"NaN","amount_usd":8.7728103E9,"headcount":15635},{"company_id":1084595.0,"company_name":"Dreamcatcher","seniority_level":"CXO","title":"CEO","started_on":"2002-01-01","ended_on":"2019-05-01"}]}
