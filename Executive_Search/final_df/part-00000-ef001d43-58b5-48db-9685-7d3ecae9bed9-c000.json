I've always wanted to open a message to strangers with that, ever since I attended the Second Grade and was tasked with coming up with a greeting for a sign in the hallway. People were pitching ideas left and right, from \"Hi, Friends\"​ to \"Hello, Pals\"​. Upon offering the synonym, \"Chums\"​, the class understandably giggled at the funny-sounding name. However, as the laughter died, my teacher turned to me and smugly chortled out, \"Well Max, most people reading this will NOT be your chums,\"​ and moved on, neglecting to write down my suggestion. This confused me and continued to do so for the following seventeen years. Was she really suggesting that strangers in the hallway happening upon our random sign would not be my chums, but would be my \"friends\"​ or my \"pals\"​? A puzzling move by a sculptor of young minds, but I didn't much care for her anyway. She once backed into my parents'​ car in the school parking lot and attempted to dodge insurance claims.

Her 19 year strong PR journey has seen her not only execute some of the most exciting and successful campaigns, but also demonstrate her advocacy strength on the importance of transforming the industry’s ‘way of work’.  For her, understating the land’s social narrative shapes how and where one should place their brand messages – whether it be hard or soft news.  It can never be a one size fits all approach – a strategy that continues to list her among some of the great PR and social media minds in South Africa.\\n\\nIn 2002, Marang co-founded Dreamcatcher Multimedia, an agency that offered integrated communication solutions such as public relations, brand activations, events and conferencing. More recently, her passion to specialise in pure brand communication has seen Marang venture out on her own business journey that she hopes will assist in positively tipping clients’ brand scales.\\n\\nOutside of business, Marang prides herself as an active social media activist and commentator on topics such as entrepreneurship, women’s rights and the powerhouse that is Africa. She’s sat on communications and advertising judging panels – learning and discovery opportunities that she says continue to help shape how she services her own clients. These include the Loeries, South Africa’s foremost media, marketing and advertising awards, for a three-year period on the PR and Live Events panel.\\nHer most current work in her incarnation as a communications consultant includes injecting her PR magic on campaigns such the launch of D’USSE XO cognac, the Bombay Sapphire #StirCreativity campaign with Maxhosa, Momentum’s #NoApologyForMySuccess Women’s Month\\nCampaign, the first XiTsonga language drama, Giyani-Land of Blood which airs on SABC, Urban Moyo restaurant,& the Handmade Contemporary Fair","created_at":"2023-12-11T06:18:08.139Z","updated_at":"2023-10-26T15:57:22.350Z","employments":[{"title":"Publicist","started_on":"1999-01-01","ended_on":"2001-01-01"},{"title":"Independent PR Consultant","started_on":"2019-06-01","ended_on":"2019-12-01"},{"company_id":2289,"company_name":"Netflix","seniority_level":"Director","title":"Originals Publicity Director - Sub-Saharan Africa","started_on":"2020-03-01","amount_usd":8772810300.00,"headcount":15635,"stock_ticker":"NFLX","funding_name":"Post-IPO Debt","investor":"Saul Bisht"},{"company_id":1084595,"company_name":"Dreamcatcher","seniority_level":"CXO","title":"CEO","started_on":"2002-01-01","ended_on":"2019-05-01"}],"urls":[{"url_type":"linkedin","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marang-setshwaelo-8443344"}]}

My name is Savanna, and I’m a Product Manager at iHeartRadio where I’m working on making your music and podcast streaming experiences awesome. I started my career in management consulting at Deloitte, went back to school to learn how to code (thanks, GA!), and transitioned into a Product Management role.

Over the last few years, I’ve worked in the creator coming on both of one of the most popular livestreaming apps, Streamlabs, as well as on Spotify’s podcast strategy. Previously, I was the first B2B marketer at The Muse, a career advising website, and built Box's sales webinar program. I'm a lifelong storyteller with 20 years of experience in photojournalism, including several active art projects. Currently, I'm learning as much about AI as I can, knowing how much it's going to change marketing online.My specializations include growth marketing, content strategy, podcast monetization, and product positioning. I led a team of five marketers in my last role at Logitech for Creators, as we created the company's first hardware + software value proposition. I'm also available for consultations on digital marketing strategy and I mentor young professionals with similar interests - feel free to get in touch.","created_at":"2023-12-11T06:18:08.139Z","updated_at":"2023-10-26T15:57:22.350Z","education":[{"institution_id":207139,"institution_name":"University of Chicago","degree":"BA","subject":"Political Science"},{"institution_name":"John Jay High School"}],"employments":[{"company_id":10110466,"company_name":"Themuse.Com","seniority_level":"Manager","title":"Demand Generation Manager","started_on":"2015-10-01","ended_on":"2016-08-01"},{"company_id":222,"company_name":"Box","title":"Demand Marketing Specialist","started_on":"2014-07-01","ended_on":"2015-09-01"},{"company_id":222,"company_name":"Box","title":"Demand Marketing Specialist","started_on":"2014-07-20","ended_on":"2015-09-30"},{"title":"Freelance Photography","started_on":"2011-09-01","ended_on":"2017-12-01"},{"title":"Freelance Photojournalist","started_on":"2006-06-01","ended_on":"2007-09-01"},{"title":"Marketing and Photography Intern","started_on":"2011-03-01","ended_on":"2011-09-01"},{"seniority_level":"Director","title":"Marketing Director","started_on":"2016-09-01","ended_on":"2017-12-01"},{"title":"Teacher","started_on":"2006-12-01","ended_on":"2007-12-01"},{"company_id":237567,"company_name":"The University of Chicago Medicine","title":"Marketing And Photography Intern","started_on":"2011-03-01","ended_on":"2011-09-01"},{"company_id":7409274,"company_name":"Coso Cloud","seniority_level":"Manager","title":"Associate Marketing Manager","started_on":"2013-02-01","ended_on":"2014-07-01"},{"company_id":4053,"company_name":"Spotify","seniority_level":"Manager","title":"Senior Marketing Manager","started_on":"2019-03-01","amount_usd":11991621471.00,"headcount":13917,"stock_ticker":"SPOT","funding_name":"Post-IPO Equity","investor_company_id":13594,"investor":"ValueAct Capital"},{"company_id":89,"company_name":"Gannett","title":"Freelance Photojournalist","started_on":"2006-06-01","ended_on":"2007-09-01"},{"company_id":246293,"company_name":"Gimlet Media","seniority_level":"Manager","title":"Senior Marketing Manager","started_on":"2017-12-01"},{"company_id":246293,"company_name":"Gimlet Media","seniority_level":"Manager","title":"Senior Marketing Manager","started_on":"2017-12-04"},{"company_id":1564751,"company_name":"Connect Solutions","seniority_level":"Manager","title":"Associate Marketing Manager","started_on":"2013-02-01","ended_on":"2014-07-01"},{"company_id":39904,"company_name":"Aon plc","title":"Client And Market Leadership Intern","started_on":"2008-06-01","ended_on":"2008-08-01","amount_usd":10536492780.00,"headcount":49636,"stock_ticker":"AON","funding_name":"Post-IPO Debt","investor":"Citibank NA"},{"company_id":924,"company_name":"Animoto","title":"Business Development Intern","started_on":"2012-08-01","ended_on":"2013-02-01"},{"company_id":2391,"company_name":"Kaplan","title":"Teacher","started_on":"2006-12-01","ended_on":"2007-12-01"},{"company_id":98418,"company_name":"The Muse","seniority_level":"Manager","title":"Demand Generation Manager","started_on":"2015-10-01","ended_on":"2016-08-01"},{"company_id":510461,"company_name":"Hewitt Associates","title":"Client and Market Leadership Intern","started_on":"2008-06-01","ended_on":"2008-08-01"},{"company_id":531,"company_name":"TechCrunch","title":"Volunteer Coordinator","started_on":"2012-01-01","ended_on":"2012-01-01"},{"company_id":531,"company_name":"TechCrunch","title":"Volunteer Coordinator","started_on":"2012-01-01","ended_on":"2012-01-01"}],"urls":[{"url_type":"linkedin","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahzadahsan"},{"url_type":"github","url":"github.com/shahzadahsan"}]}

I have been in the Hospitality industry for 5 years now. I also have 3 years working in the restaurant industry with bartending experience. I started my hotel career as a front desk agent/Night Auditor in Palmdale, CA, and progressively worked up to being promoted to an Operations Manager in a little over 2 1/2 years. All of my moves from each hotel have been promotional based. I've gained majority of my knowledge, leadership, and management techniques from my mentors in Palmdale, CA. I moved out to Orange County, CA after taking on a promotional step to broaden my options in a much bigger market. I was then offered an Operations/Assistant General Manager position at a property in North Hollywood, CA. I believe I have the most energetic and motivational personality and mindset to grow within any industry. I constantly create new goals and I’m beyond ambitions to become successful, and will take on any industry in positive full force.","created_at":"2023-12-11T06:18:08.139Z","updated_at":"2023-10-14T21:35:03.103Z","customer_id":"7538cb11-1c23-4c76-87c7-5111a0f166dc","education":[{"institution_name":"University Of Mixology"},{"institution_name":"Highlands High School","ended_on":"2010-01-01"},{"institution_name":"Antelope Valley College","subject":"Psychology"},{"institution_name":"Antelope Valley College","subject":"Marketing;Business Management","started_on":"2010-01-01","ended_on":"2012-01-01"}],"employments":[{"company_id":232901,"company_name":"Olive Garden","title":"Server","started_on":"2018-12-01","ended_on":"2020-11-01"},{"title":"Assistant Front Office Manager","started_on":"2017-04-01","ended_on":"2017-12-01"},{"title":"Night MOD","started_on":"2015-01-01","ended_on":"2015-08-01"},{"company_id":490581,"company_name":"TLK Fusion","title":"Sales Originator","started_on":"2021-02-01","ended_on":"2021-06-01"},{"company_id":490581,"company_name":"TLK Fusion","seniority_level":"Director","title":"Director of Retail Distribution","started_on":"2021-01-01","ended_on":"2021-06-01"},{"company_id":490581,"company_name":"TLK Fusion","title":"Celebrity & Influencer Relations","started_on":"2020-11-01","ended_on":"2021-06-01"},{"company_id":545563,"company_name":"Ramada Inn","title":"Operations Manager","started_on":"2015-08-01","ended_on":"2017-04-01"},{"company_id":111543,"company_name":"Buffalo Wild Wings","title":"Bartender","started_on":"2016-04-01","ended_on":"2017-04-01"},{"company_id":310577,"company_name":"PHP Agency","title":"Financial Consultant","started_on":"2018-07-01","ended_on":"2019-01-01"},{"company_id":564233,"company_name":"Staybridge Suites","title":"Front Desk Agent","started_on":"2013-08-01","ended_on":"2015-05-01"},{"company_id":8179796,"company_name":"Holiday Inn Express","title":"Assistant General Manager","started_on":"2017-12-01","ended_on":"2018-12-01"},{"company_id":1660,"company_name":"Apple","title":"Sales Specialist","started_on":"2021-09-01","amount_usd":31949031445.00,"headcount":224704,"stock_ticker":"AAPL","funding_name":"Private Equity","investor_company_id":6084,"investor":"Interscope Records"},{"company_id":1660,"company_name":"Apple","title":"Lead ISE","started_on":"2023-02-01","amount_usd":31949031445.00,"headcount":224704,"stock_ticker":"AAPL","funding_name":"Private Equity","investor_company_id":6084,"investor":"Interscope Records"}],"urls":[{"url_type":"linkedin","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendon-tago-699096148"},{"url_type":"facebook","url":"facebook.com/brendon.tago"}]}

Mich faszinieren die Möglichkeiten, Botschaften über alle Kanäle an die offenen Ohren von Kunden, Konsumenten und Klienten zu bringen. Analog und digital. Als Business Developer mache ich den Weg frei für Audio-Inhalte jeglicher Art.\\n\\nMein Rüstzeug habe ich in der Radiovermarktung erworben. Webradio und Podcast habe ich in ihrer Entwicklung in Deutschland begleitet und (werbe-)marktfähig gemacht - und dabei die gesamte Marketingklaviatur eingesetzt.\\n\\nIch verstehe gleichermaßen die Wünsche und Anforderungen von Publishern, Werbungtreibenden und Mediaagenturen. Ich analysiere Märkte, erarbeite marktgerechte Angebote und setze Marktforschungsstudien auf, um Erfolge zu überprüfen.\\n\\nDabei hilft mir mein tiefes Verständnis vom Medien- und besonders vom Audio-Markt. Mit meinen kommunikativen und didaktischen Fähigkeiten entwickle und vermittle ich komplexe Sachverhalte sowie innovative Technologien und mache sie so für die Marktpartner wirtschaftlich nutzbar. Als Manager, aber auch als Speaker und Moderator.\\n\\nZusammen mit Kollegen und Geschäftspartnern will ich bestmögliche Ergebnisse erzielen und Erfolge feiern. Und wenn Resultate beim ersten Mal nicht gut genug waren, dann drehe ich gern die Extra-Runde. Auf Augenhöhe und mit der notwendigen Ausdauer.\\n\\nAuch wenn die Arbeit getan ist, bleiben natürlich die Ohren offen und ich freue mich, dass ich beim Segeln den Wind pfeifen, beim Skifahren den Schnee knirschen und beim Joggen Podcasts hören kann. Ich mag das Stakkato des Spanischen, den Sj-Laut im Schwedischen und die bunte Vielfalt beim ESC. Und am allerliebsten das Mmmmh der Schokolade.","created_at":"2023-12-11T06:18:08.139Z","updated_at":"2023-10-26T15:57:22.350Z","employments":[{"title":"Projektmanager und Unternehmensberater","started_on":"2003-04-01","ended_on":"2003-11-01"},{"title":"Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter","started_on":"1999-04-01","ended_on":"2003-03-01"},{"company_id":9904428,"company_name":"Selbstständig","title":"Medienberater, Marktforscher, Moderator","started_on":"2016-05-01","ended_on":"2020-06-01"},{"company_id":4053,"company_name":"Spotify","seniority_level":"Director","title":"Podcast Account Director Germany","started_on":"2020-07-01","amount_usd":11991621471.00,"headcount":13917,"stock_ticker":"SPOT","funding_name":"Post-IPO Equity","investor_company_id":13594,"investor":"ValueAct Capital"},{"company_id":321427,"company_name":"RMS Radio Marketing Service GmbH und Co KG","title":"Zuletzt Leiter Publisher & Portfolio Management","started_on":"2003-12-01","ended_on":"2015-11-01"}],"urls":[{"url_type":"linkedin","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-lars-peters"}]}
